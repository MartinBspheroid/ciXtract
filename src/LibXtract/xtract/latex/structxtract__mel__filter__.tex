\subsection{Detailed Description}
An array of pointers to functions that perform the extraction. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em $\ast$data,\-:} & a pointer to the start of the input data (usually the first element in an array)\\
\hline
{\em N,\-:} & the number of elements to be processed\\
\hline
{\em $\ast$argv,\-:} & an abitrary number of additional arguments, used to pass additional parameters to the function being called. All arguments are compulsary!\\
\hline
{\em $\ast$result,\-:} & a pointer to the first element in the result\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
Each function will iterate over N array elements, the first of which is pointed to by $\ast$data. It is up to the calling function to ensure that the array is in the format expected by the function being called.

For scalar and delta features, $\ast$result will point to a single value.

For vector features it will point to the first element in an array.

Memory for this array must be allocated and freed by the calling function.

All functions return an integer error code as descibed in the enumeration return\-\_\-codes\-\_\-

The preprocessor macro\-: X\-T\-R\-A\-C\-T must be defined before this can be used

example\-:\par
 \begin{DoxyVerb}#include <stdio.h>
#define XTRACT
#include "libxtract.h"

main () {
double values[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
int N = 5;
double mean;

xtract[MEAN]((void *)values, N, NULL, &mean);

printf("Mean = %.2f\n", mean);
}
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The calling function may additionally make some tests against the value returned by xtract\-A structure to store a set of n\-\_\-filters Mel filters
